## Introduction

BlackJackPractice is an iOS app designed to help users master blackjack by practicing splits, soft totals, and hard totals. This app demonstrates the power of using advanced AI tools like GPT-4 to create an iOS app with minimal coding knowledge. By following GPT-4 instructions, users can create a fully functional app with ease. 

The app's code is generated using [Reflect's](https://reflect.app/) AI Palette, using the prompt:

```
